    "This notebook is intended to be used as a starting point for your experiments. The instructions can be found in the MLP2025_26_CW1_Spec.pdf (see Learn,  Assignment Submission, Coursework 1). The methods provided here are just helper functions. If you want more complex graphs such as side by side comparisons of different experiments you should learn more about matplotlib and implement them. Before each experiment remember to re-initialize neural network weights and reset the data providers so you get a properly initialized experiment. For each experiment try to keep most hyperparameters the same except the one under investigation so you can understand what the effects of each are."
